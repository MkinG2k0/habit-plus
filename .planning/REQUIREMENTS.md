| Feature                                         | Reason                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Social feed / likes / subscriptions             | Does not improve core quick-log value in v1          |
| Advanced metrics by default (RPE/RIR/readiness) | Increases complexity for beginner audience           |
| Native mobile apps                              | Web-first release is prioritized                     |
| AI-generated training plans in v1               | High complexity and low confidence for first release |
