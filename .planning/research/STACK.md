# Technology Stack (2026) — habit

**Scope:** subsequent milestone (fast logging, progress charts, exercise category UX)  
**Context:** existing React + TypeScript + Zustand app, local-first v1 (no auth/cloud yet)  
**Researched:** 2026-04-14

## Recommended Stack (Prescriptive)

## What To Build With This Stack (for this milestone)

1. Keep existing React + TS + Zustand baseline; avoid framework churn.
2. Move workout history reads/writes for charts to Dexie (not raw localStorage).
3. Implement fast logging forms on react-hook-form + zod schemas (`exercise -> sets -> weight/reps`).
4. Upgrade `recharts` to `3.8.x` and implement focused progress charts (weight/reps trends).
5. Keep Axios abstraction in place, but do not introduce server-state complexity in local-only v1.

## What NOT to use (and why)

| Avoid                                                       | Why not now                                                              | Use instead                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Full backend stack now (Supabase/Firebase/Auth)             | Conflicts with local-only v1 scope; slows delivery of core UX            | Local-first with Dexie, prepare API boundaries only |
| Heavy global state platforms (Redux Toolkit for everything) | Adds boilerplate for current scope; app already uses Zustand effectively | Zustand slices + focused hooks                      |
| Overpowered charting stacks (ECharts/Highcharts) for MVP    | Heavier setup/footprint than needed for simple progress lines/bars       | Recharts                                            |
| Raw `localStorage` as long-term primary DB                  | Weak querying/indexing for growing workout history                       | IndexedDB via Dexie                                 |
| Premature TanStack Query-first architecture                 | Server state is not core in v1 local-only mode                           | Introduce TanStack Query in sync milestone          |

## Upgrade notes from current repo

- `typescript` is currently `~5.8.3` -> target `6.0.x` in a controlled upgrade pass.
- `recharts` is currently `2.15.4` -> target `3.8.x` before chart feature rollout.
- `vite` alias already points to `rolldown-vite@7.1.12`; converge on supported `vite@8.0.x` strategy in one step (with migration check).

## Practical install set (new additions)

```bash
npm install dexie dexie-react-hooks react-hook-form zod @hookform/resolvers
```
